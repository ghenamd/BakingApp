# BakingApp
Baking App Udacity Project
Project Overview
You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

### What Will I Learn?
In this project you will:

Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
Handle error cases in Android.
Add a widget to your app experience.
Leverage a third-party library in your app.
Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
### App Description
Your task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacity’s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

The JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images you will need to complete this project. Don’t assume that all steps of the recipe have a video. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all.

One of the skills you will demonstrate in this project is how to handle unexpected input in your data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.
